SVN CHEAT GUIDE


Ignore Files and Folders

EASY
(go into the directory you want to modify)
svn propset svn:ignore DIRNAME .

svn propedit svn:ignore DIRNAME . (no slash on the name)
svn propset svn:ignore dirname .

When you run that command svn will open your text editor, and this is where you can define patterns or specific files to ignore. If you place a * in the property file, it will ignore all files in the directory you specified ./some_path

e.g. 
* => all
*.class => .class files
test_* => test files

Un-add a folder or file

svn revert FOLDER_OR_FILE_NAME
may need to use

svn revert --depth infinity FOLDER_OR_FILE_NAME

svn ci -m "Your check in message here." FOLDER_OR_FILE_NAME
